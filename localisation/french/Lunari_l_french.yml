EMPIRE_DESIGN_lunariciv_desc:0 "Nothing confounds a xenobiologist more than bringing up the subject of Naerelýn, the Children of the Moon. They originate from a nearly dead frozen world. Said world orbits a pair of black holes. The only light in their system is provided by a strange glowing moon that somehow repels any attempt at scanning. By all accounts they shouldn't exist at all.\n\nThe Moon Elves themselves find such questions extremely foolish. The answer is obvious: they were created by their Goddess and any fool that wishes to dispute the fact should simply have a look at their Moon.\n\nRelative newcomers to the galactic scene, the Naerelýn seem generally friendly and approachable, though they rarely move away from home. There are whispers that they eradicate, in ways most agonizing, anyone that disrespects or double crosses them. Such talk however is likely the result of idle minds as there have never been any formal accusations. Or at least, no one survived long enough to lodge any.\n"
