At the same time, it comes with a large number of new game contents including Easter egg relics, Dynamic difficulty system, Planet population capacity, New map mode, New war mode, Technology linkage system, Automatic Station construction, Universal compatibility and Supreme cheating system. If you don’t need these new features, you can just disable the framework by clicking the big LOGO. Even if the framework is disabled, it still provides all basic support for sub-modules and 3rd-party mods. \nSome compatible mods such as Strategic resources, Habitat types and Modifier fix have been integrated, and they have been customized for this mod.§!"
