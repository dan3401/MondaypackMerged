 utopia.2010.c.desc:0 "Of note are also the large debris fields surrounding the sphere. Although the chad-structure itself is ancient, much of the debris in the system appears to be significantly younger. Most of it seems to originate from two distinct battle fleets that pummeled each other into oblivion, possibly in a war to decide ownership over the shattered sphere at some point in more recent galactic history."
