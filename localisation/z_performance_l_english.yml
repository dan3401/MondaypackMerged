 z_performance_start_title_desc: "Since version 2.6 the £pops£§Y population§! system, which is called POPs in short, has been optimized a lot. It is very complex checking system that sweeps through all POPs in the Galaxy make sure that everyone will be assigned the right job. However, in the late game, numerous POPs still mean serious performance hit. \n\nThis pop-up window is to inform you that §YInfinite Collection: POP-Job Checking System Optimization§! is working and request for your permission to perform the optimization.\n\n§GOptimization§! won't have noticeable influence on gameplay but dramatically boost performance. Certainly, you can manaully turn on the optimization later, and make detailed setting in the customization menu."

 z_mm_tips_pf_btn_misc_guide: "Guide to §GInfinite Stellaris§!: Job Checking Optimization\n\nChange job assignment mechanisms to improve controllability. Now, three solutions are provided for excessive unemployed pops.\n\n§YJob Checking Optimization§!: Change the mode how job is checking to make the pop mechanism in accordance with the optimization method of version 2.3 or just turn off job checking and use manual checking instead. In some cases, disable job checking can improve late game performance, but it may not be effective for everyone.\n\n§Y Automatic Demotion§!: It takes too long for an upper class pop to be demoted to a lower class pop, which will result in a waste of production capacity, especially when changing the planetary economic structure.\nThe function of this mechanism is to make them immediately demote and take a vacant job. §YNote: Automatic Demotion can be triggered by §BManual Detection§!, or it can be automatically triggered if §BAutomatic Migration/Automatic Pop Cleaning§! is on.§!\n\n§YProhibition of Social Class Promotion§!: Under normal circumstances, if there are vacant jobs in the upper class, the pops in the lower class will automatically leave their current job to fill it. The result is that if the industrial structure is not manipulated carefully, it may cause a large number of basic industry deficits. The function of this mechanism is to prevent economic collapse by prohibiting social class promotion.\nAfter disabling, the job priority setting will also be invalid, but you can use §BManual Checking§! to manually trigger the promotion of social classes. In addition, this function only works for players.\n\n§YAutomatic Migration/Automatic Pop Cleaning§!: The core function of this mod. It is to deal with excessive unemployed population with a flexible method. You can choose Automatic Pops Migration, of course, you can also choose to directly clean up excess pops if you don’t have enough vacant jobs. Note that the more pops, the bad the performance of game.\nThe automatic migration function will automatically determine the migration conditions and will not cause ruining to the building. At the same time, you can set the minimum pops reserved for each planet to prevent a planet from being evacuated. In addition, in order to optimize operation, you can set the frequency of automatic migration and the upper limit of migrated pops each time automatic migration executed.\n\n$z_mm_tips_pf_btn_misc_guide_mig$"
 z_mm_tips_pf_btn_misc_guide_mig: "The population migration system is subject to a variety of conditions. By default, population migration and cleanup will not cause damage to buildings or cancel buildings under construction, and population migration will also automatically detect whether the free jobs on the immigration planet can bear the current unemployed pops. The system will give priority to the planets which has been set high priority. You can also force a planet to move in or out regardless of the above conditions."

 z_pf_tips_job_checking_off: "Job checking is §Gdisabled§!"
 z_pf_tips_job_checking_off_desc: "Disable job checking can reduce the computing consumption of the system. In some cases, it can provide a certain optimization bonus for the late game with a large population. However, after disable job checking, the population will not automatically be on duty. You need to click the shortcut button at the top of the Infinite Stellaris setting panel to make a manual job assignment."
 z_pf_tips_job_checking_automatic: "Job checking has been set to §GPeriodic Automatic§!"
 z_pf_tips_job_checking_automatic_desc: "Periodic job checking will disable the original job checking system and automatically allocate jobs to all populations at a certain frequency. It should be noted that this mechanism may provide certain optimizations, but it will prevent the population from being able to be assigned a job in time, which is equivalent to an automatic version of Disable Job Checking."
 z_pf_tips_solidification: "Social Class Promotion is §HDisallowed§!"
 z_pf_tips_solidification_desc: "The prohibition of class promotion will prevent the population who already have been assigned jobs from changing their jobs. Even if you adjust the priority of jobs, only the unemployed population will be assigned new jobs. At this time, you need to use the shortcut button at the top of the setting panel of Infinite Stellaris to perform manual detection to achieve class flow and make the adjustment of job priority to take effect. However, prohibiting class promotion can increase the controllability of the economy and population to a certain extent. If you are not familiar with this function, please do not change it any more."
 z_pf_tips_uep_clean: "Cleanup of Unemployed Pops has been §HEnabled§!"
 z_pf_tips_uep_clean_desc: "This function hardly occupies any calculations, and it directly clearing the unemployed population or clearing the unemployed population who still cannot obtain jobs after population migration. Please note that the cleared population will disappear immediately, and this clearing function ignores the prevention by building damage and planet retention population, but the unemployed population that has been moved and temporarily unable to obtain jobs will not be cleared."
