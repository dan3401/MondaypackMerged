 civic_ancestor_worship_desc:1000 "The galaxy is replete with cultures whose faiths believe in some manner of life beyond death. In the case of this specific culture, not only do they embrace the idea that their ancestors' spirits continue to exist, they believe them to have a direct hand in the events of the living world. Accepting that their deceased forebears must have great insight into the happenings of the galaxy and fate, having ascended beyond the bounds of mortal matter, they look to the spirits through omens and prayer to guide their descendants down the most beneficial path."
