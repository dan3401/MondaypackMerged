The specifics have been lost to time but it was an extinction level threat. The tribes united and were victorious.\n\nSince that time the Aenarí have gradually expanded along with their dutiful servants to claim their entire world. They kept their tribal nature but have forgone the petty infighting of their ancestors.\n\nRecent technological advancements have allowed the Aenarí the ability to consider life beyond their homeworld.

elven_relic_events.0101.desc:0 "Nine unsually personable dragons responded to the beacon, seeking nothing more than a stimulating conversation. Taking advantage of the opportunity, §Y[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]§! managed to persuade them to shed light on the greatest mystery surrounding their kind: where do they come from?\n\nThe dragons were more than happy to enlighten [Root.Ruler.GetHimHer]. All of them, each with a different answer, stranger, more abstract and more contradictory than the last, and yet all nine seemed to be in perfect agreement that it was the whole truth and no detail was omitted.\n\nIn the end, the [Root.GetRulerTitle] found it impossible to discern the true answer. Nevertheless, some scholars believe that the dragons were indeed honest, but rather than take us directly to the answer, they showed us a path to reach it ourselves... one day."

elven_relic_events.0102.desc:0 "A lone dragon chanced upon the site of the summoning, offering a peculiar trade: something of 'infinite value' for merely a riddle that she could not answer in one attempt.\n\nThe price proved more difficult to meet than §Y[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]§! initially expected, exhausting dozens of ideas before [Root.Ruler.GetSheHe] finally found one witty enough to give the dragon pause. Impressed, the dragon held up her own end of the bargain: giving us a riddle to solve in exchange.\n\nThe brigthest erudites of [Root.GetName] are already losing sleep trying to solve it, but in doing so their minds have become more awake than ever."

elven_relic_events.0103.desc:0 "A vain dragon answered the call, claiming that [Root.GetSpeciesName] could divine all secrets of the universe simply by admiring her polished scales. In fact, she readily promised §Y[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]§! that great breakthroughs awaited [Root.Ruler.GetHimHer] people if [Root.Ruler.GetSheHe] could personally count all of the beautiful scales on her body.\n\nThe final count turned out to be one-hundred and sixteen, but in the process the [Root.GetRulerTitle] had spotted an uneven gap. Rather than courting the vain dragon's wrath by pointing out the imperfection, [Root.Ruler.GetSheHe] lied that there were exactly one-hundred and seventeen scales.\n\nPleased with the answer, the dragon complimented [Root.GetRulerName]'s diligence and left.\n\nA single scale remained after her departure and scientists cannot wait to examine it."

elven_relic_events.0104.desc:0 "A wise elder dragon came by the beacon this time, graciously accepting the offerings and deciding to repay by regaling §Y[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]§! with the wisdom of millennia past, tales of civilizations long gone and stars so old and alien that [Root.Ruler.GetSheHe] was unsure if they could even be found in this galaxy, or this universe.\n\nThe [Root.GetRulerTitle] had many questions, but just as [Root.Ruler.GetSheHe] was about to start asking, another dragon joined them and started spinning its own story, and then another, and another.\nNew guests kept coming and going, and as it went on, started conversing amongst themselves as if [Root.GetRulerName] was not even there. Not a single opportunity to interject presented itself for the rest of the gathering, but [Root.Ruler.GetSheHe] was content to just listen and learn.\n\nThe [Root.GetRulerTitle]'s recollections of that meeting have inspired creative souls across [Root.GetName] to try and depict those fantastical tales in art."

But maybe that should come as no surprise; the Pearl grants [Root.Ruler.GetHimHer] no power over them, it merely draws their attention. Perhaps none simply had the whim to approach this time.\n\nIf nothing else, the experience gave the [Root.GetRulerTitle] much to ponder and a healthy dose of humility to come to terms with."

When offered, the dragon asked the chef to explain in detail what it was and how it had been prepared, after which he refused and requested a different dish. The situation repeated no less than eight more times, at which point the dragon finally declared that his curiosity had been sated.\n\nIn exchange, he promised that he would bring life-giving rain to all [Root.GetAdj] worlds so that we might come up with even more plentiful and diverse cuisine."

The last one to arrive stayed a little longer and was persuaded to explain the others' strange behaviour. As it turned out, they had simply found [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] boring and their offerings unworthy of attention. They judged us so by beholding our craftsmanship, which had apparently 'lost its novelty' and stagnated.\n\nSuffice to say, artisans across [Root.GetName] took the harsh judgement as a challenge and impetus to innovate."

elven_relic_events.0108.desc:0 "A jade-scaled dragon answered the summons but would not speak, and rather than take any of the presented offerings, left us a gift instead and vanished promptly thereafter. The unexpected memento was a small piece of jadeite ore, a rare sight in this day and age given that its natural deposits had been mined out since ancient times, yet hardly valuable thanks to modern synthesis technology.\n\nHowever, further examination of the sample revealed physical properties that the gem should not possess - this 'draconic jade' is an excellent energy conductor, is harder than duranium and clearer than most synthetic lens crystals!\n\nMoreover, mining facilies across [Root.GetName] report that deposits of this baffling mineral have sprung up overnight as far as the eye can see!"

Neither willing to back down from their claim, they began to fight. Although incredibly fascinating to watch at first, the duel dragged on for days and the collateral damage of it was beginning to take its toll on planetary and orbital infrastructure.\n\nIn an attempt to put a stop to it, §Y[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]§! proposed a truce between the two. Since it was clear that neither could defeat the other in combat, [Root.Ruler.GetSheHe] proposed that [Root.GetName] would serve as impartial safekeepers of the Pearl until such a time that either of them could convince the other of the validity of their claim. Much to the [Root.GetRulerTitle]'s relief and no small amount of surprise, the rival dragons accepted the terms without question and went their separate ways."

He would accompany our fleets and keep them out of danger as well as safeguard the peace and safety of our planets.\n\nExactly how he means to back that bold claim remains to be seen, but the [Root.GetRulerTitle] saw no reason to refuse him."
